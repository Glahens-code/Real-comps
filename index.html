<h1>hello Glahens</h1>

  <p>
 Water, Earth, Fire, Air. Long ago the four nations lived together in harmony but everything changed when the fire nation attacked. Only the avatar master of all 4 elements could stop them ,but when the world needed him the most the vanished. 
   100 years later my brother and I found the new avatar: an airbender named Aang. Although his air bending skills were great he had a lot to learn before he can save anyone. but Believe aang can save the world.
